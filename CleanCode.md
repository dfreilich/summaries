 ## Summary
Clean Code is an incredibly rich depiction of best practices in Agile software craftsmanship. Robert Martin, together with a number of other famed Software Engineers and Architects, take you point by point through a vast number of heuristics and best practices in creating good, solid, clean code. Through a number of refactoring exercises, Clean Code tries to teach an art, and show how best to design and continuously improve software products.

> I won't summarize everything throughout the book (there may be some chapters I skip). For example, there are a number of chapters where the authors bring you through some refactoring examples, where a summary just isn't enough.
