 ## Summary
Clean Code is an incredibly rich depiction of best practices in Agile software craftsmanship. Robert Martin, together with a number of other famed Software Engineers and Architects, take you point by point through a vast number of heuristics and best practices in creating good, solid, clean code. Through a number of refactoring exercises, Clean Code tries to teach an art, and show how best to design and continuously improve software products.

> I won't summarize everything throughout the book (there may be some chapters I skip). For example, there are a number of chapters where the authors bring you through some refactoring examples, where a summary just isn't enough.

## Key Parts:
If you have limited time, and want to get the most value, I would delve deeply into [Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics](#Chapter-17:-Smells-and-Heuristics), to get a detailed list of all of their compiled best practices in creating so called __*clean code*__.

## Chapter 1: Clean Code
## Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
## Chapter 3: Functions
## Chapter 4: Comments
## Chapter 5: Formatting
## Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures
## Chapter 7: Error Handling
## Chapter 8: Boundaries
## Chapter 9: Unit Tests
## Chapter 10: Classes
## Chapter 11: Systems
## Chapter 12: Emergenece
## Chapter 13: Concurrency
## Chapter 14: Successive Refinement
## Chapter 15: JUnit Internals
## Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate
## Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics
Here, Robert Martin lists a few series of heuristics and code smells he uses to refactor. This is the real gem of the book, and should be revisted often.
### Comments:
#### C1: Innappropriate Information
Comments shouldn't hold information that is better held in a different system, like your source code control system. Meta-data such as authors, when it was last modified, and the such shouldn't appear in comments. __*Comments should be reserved for technical notes about the code and design.*__
#### C2: Obsolete Comment
Comments get old, irrelevant, and incorrect very quickly. If it become sthat, update it or get rid of it as quickly as possible. __*It is best not to write a comment that will become obsolete.*__
#### C3: Redundant Comment
A redundant comment is one that describes something that adequately describes itself. This is especially relevant if one is following [G20](####-G20:-Function-Names-Should-Say-What-They-Do) and [N1](####-N1:-Choose-Descriptive-Names), writing your code with descriptive names for variables and methods.

#### C4: Poorly Written Comment
If you are going to write a comment, take the time to make sure it is the best comment you can write. __*Use correct grammer and punctuation. Don't ramble. Don't state the obvious. Be brief.*__

#### C5: Commented-Out Code
If there is commented-out code, __*delete it.*__ Your source code remembers it, if it is critical, and it clogs up your limited attention.

### Environment
#### E1: Build Requires More Than One Step
Building a project should be a single trivial operation. __*Everything your program needs to run should be available right when you check it out â€“ you should be able to check out the system with one simple command, and then issue one other simple command to build it.*__
> Correllary: Prefer some other solution to `git submodules`, which can bugs when checking out/building.
#### E2: Tests Require More Than One Step
You should be able to run all the unit test with just one simple command, that should be explicitly told to users.

### Functions
#### F1: Too Many Arguments
Functions should have a small number of arguments. __*No argument is best, followed by one, two, and three. More than three is very questionable, and should be avoided with prejudice.*__
#### F2: Output Arguments
Output arguments (having your function change something in an object that is solely passed in as an input) are counterintuitive. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of the object it is called on.
> This, to me, is exemplified by the Golang pattern of writing into buffers provided. It allows for extensibility, but it does sometime make it more counterintuitive than not.
#### F3: Flag Arguments
If there is a boolean argument, that is a clear indication that the function does more than one thing, violating [G30](####-G30:-Functions-Should-Do-One-Thing).

#### F4: Dead Function
If a method is never called, it should be deleted, similar to [C5](####-C5:-Commented-Out-Code)

### General
#### G1: Multiple Languages in One Source File
Multiple languages (such as Java, XML, HTML, YAML, JavaDoc, and plain English comments) in a file require more context switching, and make files harder to read. Ideally, a source file should contain only __*one*__ language. Realistically, we may need more, but try to keep it at two.

#### G2: Obvious Behavior is Unimplemented
A function or class should implement the behavior that a user could reasonably expect. . When that isn't the case, readers and users of the code can no longer depend on their intuition, and must waste time reading the code.

#### G3: Incorrect Behavior at Boundaries
> "It seems obvious to say that code should behave correctly. The problem is that we seldom realize just how complicated correct behavior is. Developers often write functions that they think will work, and then trust their intuition, rather than going to the effort to prove that their code works in all the corner and boundary cases."

> There is no replacement for due diligence. Every boundary condition, every corner case, every quirk and exception represents something that can confound and elegant and intuitive algorithm. _Don't rely on your intuition._ Look for every boundary condition, and write a test for it.

#### G4: Overridden Safeties
Turning off compiler warnings, or failing tests, may help you get a build to succeed, but often at the risk of endless debugging sessions, as you mask a more serious issue.
#### G5: Duplication
Don't duplicate. This is called the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule by some. Kent Beck made it a core principle of Extreme Programming, calling it: **"Once, and only once."**
If there is duplication, that means you could be doing something better, perhaps extracting a subroutine, another class, or more. This can either be clumps of identical code, or identical checks (if/else chains).
#### G6: Code at Wrong Level of Abstraction
Try to separate ligher level general concepts from lower level detailed concepts. **This is a hard thing to pin down, and do**. Make sure to separate concerns as much as possible, particularly when using OOP to separate out separate concerns.
> *"Isolating abstractions is one of the hardest things that software developers do, and there is no quick fix when you get it wrong."*
#### G7: Base Classes Depending on Their Derivatives
This is an example of inheritance done really wrong. We typically partition concepts into base and derivative classes, in order to separate concerns and abstractions (see [G6](####-G6:-Code-at-Wrong-Level-of-Abstraction)). If you see base classes mentioning the names of derivatives, there is an issue (though there are some exceptions)
#### G8: Too Much Information
Try to expose as little as you can, while still enabling users to do a lot of functionality.
> "Well-defined modules have very small interfaces that allow you to do a lot with a little. Poorly defined moduels have wide and deep interfaces that force you to use many different gestures to get simple things done. A well-defined interface doesn't offer very many functions to depend upon, so coupling is low. A poorly defined interface provides lots of functions that you must call, so coupling is high"
#### G9: Dead Code
Delete any code that isn't executed, particularly in logical branches that will never occur (`if`s, `try/catches`, or `switch/case` statements)
#### G10: Vertical Separation
#### G11: Inconsistency
#### G12: Clutter
#### G13: Artificial Coupling
#### G14: Feature Envy
#### G15: Selector Arguments
#### G16: Obscured Intent
#### G17: Misplaced Responsibility
#### G18: Inappropriate Static
#### G19: Use Explanatory Variables
#### G20: Function Names Should Say What They Do
#### G21: Understand the Algorithm
#### G22: Make Logical Dependencies Physical
#### G23: Prefer Polymorphism to If/Else or Switch/Case
#### G24: Follow Standard Conventions
#### G25: Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants
#### G26: Be Precise
#### G27: Structure over Convention
#### G28: Encapsulate Conditionals
#### G29: Avoid Negative Conditionals
#### G30: Functions Should Do One Thing
#### G31: Hidden Temporal Coupling
#### G32: Don't Be Arbitrary
#### G33: Encapsulate Boundary Conditions
#### G34: Functions Should Descend Only 1 Level of Abstraction
#### G35: Keep Confugrable Data at High Levels
#### G36: Avoid Transitive Navigation

#### N2: Choose Names at the Appropriate Level of Abstraction
#### N3: Use Standard Nomenclature Where Possible
#### N4: Unambiguous Names
#### N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes
#### N6: Avoid Encodings
#### N7: Names Should Describe Side Effects

### Tests
#### T1: Insufficient Tests
#### T2: Use a Coverage Tool
#### T3: Don't Skip Trivial Tests
#### T4: An Ignored Test is a Question about an Ambiguity
#### T5: Test Boundary Conditions
#### T6: Exhausitvely Test Near Bugs

## Best Quotes
> There is a difference between knowing how the code works, and knowing whether the algorithm will do the job required of it. Being unsure that an algorithm is appropriate is often a fact of life. Being unsure what your code does is just laziness. (Chapter 17, p. 298)

> Turning off failing tests and telling yourself you'll get them to pass later is as bad as pretending your credit cards are free money. (Chapter 17, p. 289)
