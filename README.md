# Summaries
This repo contains summaries of key points in computer science, and product/data books. If you catch any spelling mistakes, want to add to a summary, or have any suggestions for future books, create an issue and I'd love to take a crack at it! If you're a fan of this, and want to buy any of the books, please use the links below so I get rewarded for it.

Keep crushing it.
